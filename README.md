# IMDb Data Scraping and Analysis

## Overview

This project involves scraping data from IMDb, focusing on extracting information related to movie genres, directors, release years, ratings, and user reviews. The data is organized into a JSON structure for further analysis.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this script is to automate the collection of IMDb data for various movie genres. The script provides insights into directors, release years, ratings, and user reviews for movies within these genres.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required Python packages include `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, and `requests`.

## Usage

- It is relatively simple to run and execute this code.
- Just run the cells from start till the end.
- The cell that gives the 'DATA' dictionary and stores it as a json file is complete and accurate
- One can change the values of 'Genre' in the same cell and obtain individual jsons for different genres.
- The last cell (Final JSON Generation) is something I am still working on and some changes are supposed to be done in order to make those cells run accurately.
- Moreover, I have tried providing a schema of how my database (the json) file is organised using the JSON Pro Viewer and the database_schema_using_action_genre.png tries to provide an overview of the same.
