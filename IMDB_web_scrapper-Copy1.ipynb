I'm not sure it's deserving of cult status, but don't ask me why, I have a feeling that in years to come, this may well develop something of a following.The clue is in the title, Violent Night, and boy this film doesn't hold back, in terms of violence and manner of deaths, this film packs a real punch, you will see all sorts, people dismembered, shot, impaled, it really doesn't hold back.If Santa did actually pop down for a visit, I can imagine him being this disillusioned, this irritated, with a genuinely low opinion of people, this is where the film scores in my opinion, the performance of David Harbour, who is genuinely very good.Enjoyable music throughout, good special effects, plenty of action, Violent Night was a Christmas surprise.7/10.\",\n",

       "    {'text': 'Possibly the most tedious film question ever asked is, \"is Die Hard a Christmas movie?\" Violent Night says \"what if Die Hard WAS a Christmas movie?\"Its an excellent mix of two genres. First and foremost it\\'s a (very violent) man in a tight spot action movie but hidden beneath is a traditional Christmas story of people becoming believers and a jaded main character getting their feative mojo back.The film success is largely down to David Harbour\\'s fantastic turn as a disillusioned St Nick. His ability to project charisma even when appearing tired and fed up carries the day, or in this case, night. He also cleverly avoids the trap of playing Santa too dark, for all his boozing and necessary killing he is still recognisably Father Christmas. The rest of the cast are all decent as well, with John Leguiziamo making a fun villian. Even the child character manages to not be annoying, although some of her dialogue hints that they had originally wanted a younger actress than Leah Brady.The other big plus Violent Night has is its, well violence. The set pieces go above and beyond, with villians being impaled, burned and dismembered. Highlights include a Home Alone inspired sequence (turns out the invaders in this film are a lot less durable than Harry and Marv) and a Mortal Kombat worthy finish to the final showdown. There\\'s also a decent vain of comedy even if you won\\'t exactly be guffawing in the aisles.There are a couple of things that take you out of proceedings, like the bad guys refusal to just shoot their guns and some very generic family interactions, but overall Violent Night is a very fun couple of hours.8 lumps of coal for 10 naughty mercenaries.',\n",

       "    {'text': \"This movie is a beautiful mixture of Die Hard, Home Alone, Thor... It also contains several cliches from other movies. Not a problem. Yes, it's predictable, but it is kind of different of what we usually recieve on Christmas, and I personally appreciate different movies.First, action, gore and scenarios are great. Also the main cast. I think almost everyone here does a great job. I really enjoyed music used here too. Great choices.Second, the script is predictable but at the same time, it keeps you entertained from beginning till the end. Raw action mixed with some goofy scenes.So, overall if you want to watch a different brutal action Christmas thriller, this one is for you.\",\n",

It isn't always nearly as entertaining as it could be, but it definitely capitalises on its goofy premise in all the right ways at various points.The violence is blunt and rudimentary, but there's something strikingly effective about it. Each hit is loud and visceral, and many of the actual deaths are a lot more creative than I was expecting them to be, even if the violence leads me up to each death is pretty by-the-numbers.I was pleasantly surprised with the small but satisfying character arcs that the script weaves into the simple story. Santa is given a cynical outlook on humanity and himself to overcome, the family has tension to work out, and the mythology of Santa's backstory is actually given a twist to make his capacity for violence make sense in this movie.There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about any of this, but it's all crafted with care and it's investing enough that I could easily see myself watching this in subsequent years.Its aforementioned strengths help it largely overcome its weak supporting actors, dialogue that's sometimes so corny it's cringey, and its few too many scenes of characters sitting and talking.\",\n",

       "    {'text': 'Greetings again from the darkness. HO-HO-HO! Who is ready for the best ever Santa slasher movie? Admittedly, it\\'s a narrow sub-genre and anyone that knows me or reads my reviews, knows full well that this is not the type of movie I typically recommend. However, it\\'s the season for charity and director Tommy Wirkola (HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS, 2013 - sequel in the works) and co-writers Pat Casey and John Miller (the screenwriters behind the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" films) have gifted us an extremely violent and often very funny Christmas present, replete with a sledgehammer-slinging Santa Claus.We first meet an inebriated Santa (\"I\\'m on a break\") at a local pub, where he explains to a mall Santa why he has become so disenchanted with the job ... greedy, self-centered kids who only want more video games. The booze numbs Santa\\'s disgust as he heads off on his sleigh ... and Wirkola delivers the first shocking moment as Santa\\'s barf keys us into the type of twisted tale we are about to experience. David Harbour (best known for \"Stranger Things\" and HELLBOY, 2019) is absolutely all-in for this far-from-glamorous portrait of jolly ol\\' Saint Nick. On his rounds, Santa raids household liquor stashes while chomping on cookies and eschewing skim milk. He\\'s a full-blown slob, yet still holds a soft spot for \"nice\" kids, while having little mercy for the \"naughty\" among us.Most of the story takes place at the Lightstone family compound, where one-percenter Gertrude (CHRISTMAS VACATION alum Beverly D\\'Angelo) is the foul-mouthed matriarch ruling over her entitled and unlikable family consisting of daughter Alva (Edi Patterson) and her airhead-actor husband Morgan (Cam Gigandet) and their poser teenage son Bert (Alexander Elliot). Also present for the festive evening are Gertrude\\'s son Jason (Alex Hassell), his estranged wife Linda (Alexis Louder) and their precious 7-year-old daughter Trudy (Leah Brady). Santa arrives at the Lightstone mansion not long before a team of mercenaries, led by Mr Scrooge (John Leguizamo), storm the place and take the family members hostage. Their mission is to break into the family vault and abscond with $300 million in cash.What follows is a demented mash-up of DIE HARD (1989), HOME ALONE (1990), BAD SANTA (2003), and THOR (2011). Deadly weapons used here include your expected firearms, but also a finely-honed candy cane, an icicle, a skating shoe, and a Christmas tree star, among other holiday items. Most prominent is the sledgehammer wielded by Santa, and the flashback to his pre-Santa days for explanation. The violent action is plentiful, and it\\'s well-balanced with countless lines of comedy. Surprisingly, there is a story nestled in amongst the mayhem, and the heart of it revolves around the bond between Santa and young Trudy. She\\'s a true believer in him and that overrides his uncertainty about the job, and inspires him to stick around for the fight. Santa can\\'t explain the mystique of Christmas \"magic\", but he does know an 1100 year marriage has its ups and downs.Obviously, this is not one for the kiddos (it\\'s a hard R-rating), and they should be shielded from this Yuletide yuck. Director Wirkola has delivered an instant holiday classic for those seeking the bizarro world flicks contrasting to the more respectable family fare of IT\\'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS STORY. Who would have ever thought that Festivus might be the safer holiday?Opens in theaters on December 2, 2022.',\n",

It's like a family movie though, with lots of bloody scenes. There was a lot of inexplicable stuff about Santa in the movie. This shows that there will be a second movie. According to me. Acting was good. David Harbor was great again. I liked the movie overall, except for a few cringe scenes. The action scenes weren't bad either. It was a funny movie. It was a movie that didn't take itself seriously, but took it seriously at the same time. I recommend. It was one of the best movies of 2022 for me.\",\n",

       "    {'text': \"As far as Christmas movies go, is this better than Die Hard? Of course not! However, it's no doubt a Christmas movie. David Harbor plays a Santa Claus who lost his Christmas spirit and gets it back by going total medieval on a gang of kidnappers looking to take a small fortune from the type of rich folks you hate the most over the Holiday season. Harbor's Santa reminds me a lot of his version of Hellboy, I think when it comes down to it both pictures are Metal as Hell, and it's like Mr. Stranger Things just doing vocals for both albums. Mr. John Leguizamo is in the flick as the naughtiest of naughty men (not as naughty as Hans Gruber, but who can be). Like a sick guitar riff Leguizamo brings his season experience as an actor to create an interesting and funny bad guy. Leaning towards the Home Alone factor, this movie is as violent as the title suggests, which is rare, really. The little kid in turns out to be worse than Kevin McCallister when it comes to projecting her home from criminal masterminds. It's like someone read the minds of every person that watches Die Hard on Christmas day and just wanted to give us something official. I appreciate that.\",\n",
